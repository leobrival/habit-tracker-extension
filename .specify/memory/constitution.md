# Habit Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Session-First Architecture
Every feature implementation MUST consider session state management as a primary concern. Authentication state persistence across app restarts is REQUIRED. Auto-refresh mechanisms for expired tokens are MANDATORY. Session verification on focus/navigation events is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

*Rationale: Habit tracking requires consistent user experience without repeated logins. Session interruptions break the tracking flow and reduce user engagement.*

### II. Type Safety
TypeScript strict mode MUST be enforced. All API responses MUST have defined interfaces. Runtime type validation for external data is REQUIRED. Type assertions are FORBIDDEN without explicit justification.

*Rationale: Habit data integrity is critical. Type safety prevents data corruption and ensures reliable tracking metrics.*

### III. User Experience Priority
Response times MUST be under 200ms for UI interactions. Loading states are REQUIRED for operations exceeding 100ms. Error messages MUST be user-friendly with actionable guidance. Keyboard navigation MUST be fully supported.

*Rationale: Raycast extensions compete on speed and polish. Poor UX breaks habit formation workflows.*

### IV. Backend Agnostic
API base URL MUST be configurable via Raycast preferences. No hardcoded service URLs are permitted. Authentication mechanisms MUST support multiple backend implementations. API contracts MUST be documented and versioned.

*Rationale: Users need flexibility in backend choice. Self-hosted solutions and different service providers must be supported.*

### V. Security & Privacy
Session tokens MUST be stored in Raycast LocalStorage with encryption. API credentials MUST NEVER be hardcoded. Failed authentication attempts MUST trigger automatic logout. All user data MUST be transmitted over HTTPS.

*Rationale: Habit data is personal and sensitive. Security breaches destroy user trust and violate privacy expectations.*

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation Requirements
All features MUST pass TypeScript compilation without errors. ESLint rules MUST pass with zero warnings. API integration tests MUST exist and pass before UI implementation.

### Testing Standards
Session management MUST have integration tests covering token refresh scenarios. Error handling MUST be tested for network failures and API errors. User workflows MUST have end-to-end validation.

### Performance Standards
Extension startup MUST complete within 300ms. API requests MUST implement timeout and retry logic. Memory usage MUST not exceed 50MB during normal operation.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Process
All changes MUST pass `ray lint` before commit. TypeScript strict mode MUST remain enabled. Code reviews MUST verify session security and UX compliance.

### Feature Development
New features MUST start with API contract definition. Authentication integration MUST be considered in initial design. User experience testing MUST occur before feature completion.

### Release Process
All commands MUST be tested with different backend configurations. Session persistence MUST be verified across app restarts. Performance regression testing MUST occur before release.

## Governance

Constitution compliance is NON-NEGOTIABLE and supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests MUST verify adherence to core principles. Complexity additions MUST be justified against simpler alternatives. Changes to this constitution require documentation of impact across templates and development practices.
