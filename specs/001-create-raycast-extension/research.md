# Research: Create Raycast Extension

## Extension Development Environment

**Decision**: Use @raycast/api as primary framework with TypeScript
**Rationale**: Official Raycast API provides comprehensive type definitions, React-based components, and built-in utilities for extension development
**Alternatives considered**: Raw JavaScript (rejected - lacks type safety), third-party frameworks (rejected - not officially supported)

## Build and Development Tooling

**Decision**: Use ray CLI for development and build processes
**Rationale**: Official Raycast CLI provides hot reloading, linting, building, and publishing workflows specifically designed for extensions
**Alternatives considered**: Custom webpack/vite setup (rejected - maintenance overhead), tsc only (rejected - lacks dev server)

## Extension Manifest Configuration

**Decision**: Use package.json schema with @raycast/api validation
**Rationale**: Declarative configuration ensures proper metadata, command definitions, preferences, and store compatibility
**Alternatives considered**: Separate config file (rejected - not Raycast standard), code-based configuration (rejected - lacks validation)

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest for unit tests, integration tests for command workflows
**Rationale**: Jest integrates well with TypeScript, can mock Raycast API, and supports async command testing
**Alternatives considered**: Vitest (considered but Jest more established), no testing (rejected - quality requirements)

## Code Quality and Linting

**Decision**: @raycast/eslint-config with Prettier for formatting
**Rationale**: Official linting rules ensure Raycast best practices, consistent code style, and store submission requirements
**Alternatives considered**: Standard ESLint (rejected - lacks Raycast-specific rules), no linting (rejected - constitution requirements)

## State Management

**Decision**: Raycast LocalStorage with @raycast/utils hooks
**Rationale**: Built-in persistence survives extension restarts, type-safe utilities, automatic serialization/deserialization
**Alternatives considered**: External state libraries (rejected - unnecessary complexity), manual localStorage (rejected - lacks type safety)

## Icon and Asset Management

**Decision**: PNG icons in assets/ directory with proper naming conventions
**Rationale**: Raycast requires specific icon formats, sizes, and naming for store submission and optimal display
**Alternatives considered**: SVG icons (rejected - not supported), dynamic icons (rejected - performance impact)

## Publishing Workflow

**Decision**: ray publish command with automated store submission
**Rationale**: Official publishing process handles validation, packaging, and submission to Raycast Store
**Alternatives considered**: Manual submission (rejected - error-prone), third-party tools (rejected - not officially supported)

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Lazy loading for heavy operations, memoization for expensive computations
**Rationale**: Meets <300ms startup requirement, ensures smooth UI interactions under constitutional performance standards
**Alternatives considered**: No optimization (rejected - violates constitution), aggressive caching (rejected - memory constraints)

## Error Handling

**Decision**: Try-catch with Toast notifications using @raycast/api
**Rationale**: User-friendly error display, consistent with Raycast UX patterns, actionable error messages
**Alternatives considered**: Console-only errors (rejected - poor UX), modal dialogs (rejected - disruptive)
