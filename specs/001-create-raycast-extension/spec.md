# Feature Specification: Create Raycast Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-raycast-extension`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create Raycast extension https://developers.raycast.com/"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to create a new Raycast extension so that I can build custom productivity tools that integrate seamlessly with the Raycast launcher and provide value to the Raycast community.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has an idea for a Raycast extension, **When** they follow the extension creation process, **Then** they have a working extension scaffold with proper configuration
2. **Given** the extension scaffold is created, **When** the developer runs the development environment, **Then** the extension loads successfully in Raycast
3. **Given** the extension is developed, **When** the developer builds for distribution, **Then** the extension can be published to the Raycast Store

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the developer environment doesn't meet Raycast extension requirements?
- How does the system handle invalid extension configurations or metadata?
- What occurs when there are conflicts with existing extensions during development?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide extension scaffold generation with proper TypeScript configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST include Raycast API integration and type definitions
- **FR-003**: Extension MUST support both view and no-view command types
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide development environment with hot reloading capabilities
- **FR-005**: Extension MUST include proper manifest configuration with metadata, commands, and preferences
- **FR-006**: System MUST support extension building and packaging for distribution
- **FR-007**: Extension MUST follow Raycast design guidelines and UX patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide linting and code quality tools specific to Raycast extensions
- **FR-009**: Extension MUST support proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable extension publishing workflow to Raycast Store

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Extension Manifest**: Configuration file defining extension metadata, commands, preferences, and permissions
- **Command**: Individual actions available to users within the extension (view-based or headless)
- **Preference**: User-configurable settings that customize extension behavior
- **Asset**: Icons, images, and other resources used by the extension
- **API Integration**: External service connections that extend extension functionality
